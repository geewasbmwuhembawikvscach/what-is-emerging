In this episode of emerge and speaking with Vinay Gupta

Vinay is the founder of mattereum, the creator of the Hexayurt (http://hexayurt.com/), and part of the team that launched the Ethereum crypto project. Vinay is also a serious spiritual practitioner, having spent over a decade of his life completely dedicated to the path of awakening. This conversation, as you'll hear is rather brutal. Vinay has a way of blowing up sacred cows and puncturing minute beliefs. It's a rare gift, especially when it comes to the topic of spirituality. And it can't help but be very confrontational. 

As with last week's conversation with Jim Bendel, the primary topic here is collapse and the real possibility of near term human extinction. We also go on to myth-bust, about how this topic of collapse relates to spiritual practice and awakening. 

This conversation, I found it to be very sobering and at the same time, uniquely enlivening. This is valuable stuff. I hope you enjoy. One last thing, you'll notice that there's a new logo for the show. And this is part of the beginning stages of the collaboration between this emerge podcast project and the new emerge online platform. 

This this collaboration will express itself in various ways over time. And for now, I would invite you if you enjoyed this podcast, To go check out the platform, the Emerge platform, you can find it at https://whatisemerging.com. And it's already full of great stories and articles and videos with a lot of faces and names that you'll recognize from conversations on the show. So go ahead and check that out if you haven't already, and really excited to be a part of this emerging project.

Okay, enjoy the show.

Welcome back to another episode of Emerge. This time on the show I'm excited to welcome Vinay Gupta. Vinay is somebody who I've followed for, oh, maybe the past five or six years. I think it's probably the case that most people know of him from his involvement with Ethereum, and just being a kind of public intellectual within the blockchain space. 

So I found out about him, um, before that when he was tweeting about enlightenment, spiritual practice and enlightenment, and the hexi-yurt, which I think I think I first heard you speak about the hexa-yurt and then you also mentioned that you were enlightened within the Hindu tradition. That was like, Oh, that's really interesting that you know, you're both developing thing kind of a collapse-related disaster relief materials, and you're deeply practice within a spiritual tradition. And so, you know, we're not here to talk about blockchain. We're here. In particular two talks about the relationship between the what we might call the inevitable near term collapse of many different social systems and spiritual practice. At least that's where we're gonna start. And so um, Vinay I imagine, like I said that most people know you from Ethereum. So for those who don't know, what is your background with spiritual training.

Vinay Gupta  5:44  
Um, so I was raised agnostic. My father was a Hindu research scientist, largely non-practicing. My mother was a Scottish sort of default Christian de facto atheist. So I got about 14, I got very ill I got chronic fatigue syndrome. And somewhere in there, I found Paul Wilson's book, The Calm Technique. And the Calm Technique is a little crooked house, hundred pages or something. And it describes yourself as being a kind of demystifies gait meditation. And what it teaches is mantra meditation. And there's about stuff about posture and diet and the kinds of things you might experience. But there's no mystical stuff in the at all. And so I picked it up and I did it for more than an hour a day for the next eight years.

And large parts of thought were or two or three hours a day practice.

At the time, I was also in therapy, and it specifically Rogerian Therapy, but we've been called Person Centered therapy. And that's probably after the four or five years meditation thats kicked in. And that was the backbone of my spiritual practice for the first really eight years. Then in about 94, there was a very, very sudden acceleration, but not much happened for the first eight years, I didn't experience any real changes in consciousness. And then it sort of all caught up with me simultaneously and my internal dialogue completely stopped. So there was just no voice inside of my head, I moved into this kind of persistently silent condition. I thought I'd gone completely insane, like I'd broken myself, happened to be reading the yoga sutras of Patanjali at the time B.K.S. Iyengar translation. And at that point, it was like, oh, okay, so what I'm describing and what I'm experiencing are about a third of the way into the states, as we've described. This is purely for me, right, whatever these people are doing that's my stuff. It's my heritage It's my culture, but it's also the only map of reality I've got access to which I can find myself. Great, I'm a Hindu and that eventually led me to meet a guru who had trained under haidakhan Baba, who is one of these kind of controversial wizards, the Kriya Yoga tradition. And I studied under her for a number of years, very, very intensely. And you know, she was the kind of person that casually put your life at risk if she thought it was good for you, and did. And after a few years of that kind of treatment, I woke up very, very seriously like, boom. And then after I woke up, up until that point, I'd been working kind of just enough to pay the bills, but I tried to stay away from money as much as I could. And after that point, you know, literally the week after I got enlightened, I got a decent job, but I sat down, and I started trying to build some kind of standard Hindu household or life where I had a little design job working for a web design firm and a girlfriend a nice apartment. And I was just like Hindu householder track, everything seemed fine. I think it would have been circumstances and then about a year before 911 everything began to come to pieces, and I moved onto a completely different trajectory. And that's what led me to kind of save the world stuff. But yeah, that's like how I got here.

Daniel Thorson  9:14  
And so and how did the save the world stuff come into your consciousness? We're coming to you.

Vinay Gupta  9:20  
And well, so there's no way of beating around the bush here. Spring of 2001 I had a vision. And the vision was basically comedic. It was it was funny, it was clearly intended to be hilarious. And basically what it showed was that the entire human race was going to die and that it didn't matter very much. But it was going to leave an enormous quantity of bureaucratic cleanup as the kind of like you know, air crash investigation like so we lost the entire planet hmm right. We're gonna have to relocate everybody in the and were going to figure out what went wrong. And you know, so there's just a sense of like, on one hand, you know, It doesn't really matter. It's just the world. And on the other hand, the bureaucracy is going to be so painful afterwards. We don't want to face it. So there was this experience being deputized by bureaucrats that we'd have to clean up after the end of the world attempt to prevent it. Not because it didn't, not because it mattered, but because it was kind of inconvenient. And, and that imprint stuck, right? I mean, my whole attitude to saving the world figures like, I've never been able to take it very seriously. It's like, Oh, my God, all these poor people that go to die, it's always seems to get did seem to be about function, which is attempting to, you know, manage the inconvenience of some number of celestial bureaucrats. But in the process, that means doing what I can to save the world. That I've been, I've been really unable to take it with full seriousness as you'd expect, because the way that it was revealed to me was straight out with like The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. Like I Well, you know, it's super inconvenient. It's really, really going to be very, very, very difficult to paperwork, my God, its going to take a long time. But on the other hand, if it doesn't work, it doesn't work, you know, like worst things happen at sea. And that's the spirit in which I proceeded.

Daniel Thorson  11:08  
Hmm. Okay. And so, from my perspective, you know, leading you on Twitter and the articles you created and other interviews with you, like these, this is really what motivates your entire life is attempting to, I don't know how you would put it but reduce the worst effects of collapse? Or how do you how do you frame like that kind of part of your life, your mission.

Vinay Gupta  11:36  
So I'm really only about preventing extinction. Right? If we manage not to kill ourselves in a hell of a hurry, you know, over the next 5000 years, we can probably work out the majority of our cultural problems, it would be a lot easier if we can get into space in a real way because that gives a lot of protection from our own stupidity. And it will also give us a bit of room to expand and some breathing space.  Past that on I have zero hope for everything else. Right? All of our cultural agendas over notions of fairness and goodness and human well being and spiritual value and all the rest of that crap. We have blown everything there is to blow on all of those levels. The culture is a shambles. We live in an open air death comp. We fucked everything that you could possibly fuck. And we'll be lucky if we manage not to go extinct. So my core advice to everybody is abandon all lesser causes, none of its real. none of it matters. It all goes down the tubes if we go extinct, and going extinct is probably the most likely outcome, not because of global warming. But because of the political changes which will come as a result of radically increased resource scarcity brought about by global warming, right? It's the nuclear weapons and it's the biological weapons that are still the fundamental big killers that the more chaotic and violent stupid the world gets, the more that stuff is going to look like a solution. The more you risk of geoengineering accident or the more you risk somebody, you know, with their designer plague, who's just like, hey, let's fix the problem, we're gonna kill all the men who have this particular set of genes, they're the problem or whoever it happens to be. Right? You know, there's just a likelihood that the further you go down into the darkness, the more stupid and crazy the different solutions will be into one of them will turn out to be genocide. So yeah, I mean, you know, this is the way that I see the situation. And this is not to say that there is no hope of stabilization from things like solar panels, regenerative agricultural and all the rest of that stuff, all that stuff is there, but it shares the landscape with 50 years of biological weapons research since the point of where we learned how to efficiently deploy Anthrax. Right? You have no idea what's sitting inside of Portland Down, or Fort Detrick or the you know, Russian equivalents or the Israeli equivalents or where ever this stuff happens to be.  And similarly, officially nobody's done anything new with nuclear weapons since you know, whatever, 1980 something right. unofficially, you know that the research has continued, you know, there are nuclear weapons in space. We haven't got, you know, an either-or world it's not black or it's developing these little green shoots of a better civilization on the landscape for the vast majority of the effort the world has gone into figuring out how to kill it.

Daniel Thorson  14:28  
And, and so, I find it recently when I've mentioned that it seems to me based on my research that what you say is true, you know, that there we are kind of hurdling seemingly as quickly as we can towards some kind of collapse situation. Somebody will often say something like, Oh, this is just a repackaged eschatology. Why is this you know, for the sake of argument, it's kind of a devil's advocate of why is this actually different? Like, why is this really versus all of those fantasies of the past?

Vinay Gupta  15:03  
Well, I mean, the first thing is that the collapse occurred for most nations when the English arrived, right? So, you know, the collapse in South America is settlers bring with them a bunch of horrendous plagues. And what happens from those horrendous plague is, you know, something like 90% population mortality. You know, and this is not intentional biological warfare, right? A bunch of people turn up and European sniffles in America and South America, that turns out to be like smallpox, right? And we had a relatively new genetic resistance to our diseases. They didn't.  We arrived.  They died.  Similarly, apparently the other direction, what we picked up in terms of diseases from South American syphilis. So this sort of structural problem wipes out the vast majority of the population in North America, I think, probably a lot from in South America um and that that was an apocalypse for those peoples. Right? You know the remnants of those peoples it's the shattered remnants of civilization that was wiped out first by disease then by violence then by hundreds of years of, you know, racism, and enslavement, and torture and so. You go to China, right? The population mortality is far less from the Chinese invasions but an enormous amount of horrific stuff happened to China you know, the Whites, the Japanese, you know, you name it, the Chinese saw it.  Internal civil wars. And India, right. I mean, India has two waves of invasions, first, the Muslims come in, basically act like Nazis for the next thousand years. And then the English arrive. And, you know, the population mortality from the English rifling in India is, I don't know, something like 20 million people, right, that's killing on the same scale as Hitler, but because it's brown people rather than white people. Nobody really pays attention. And, you know, one of the things I occasionally say to Germans says, look, the reason you guys get such a bad rap is because you did your killing at home rather than to brown people a long way away. Right? If you think about what the Belgians did in the Congo, it frankly makes the Holocaust look with a storm in a teacup. Right, far more people killed in far more barbarous ways with an equal degree of genetic selectivity. This stuff was unbelievably horrific, but because it happened off camera to people that nobody cared about, rather than happening to German intellectuals with relatives all over the world. It just largely just vanished in history. So, you know, it's not that what is happening is something that is unprecedented in this sort of past of the world, right? It's what's happening is that there's a decent chance that white people are going to have a similar collapse of their standard of living to the collapse of the standard of living that happens all across the world as colonialism arrived.

Daniel Thorson  17:59  
But there does seem to difference, though, between that kind of collapse or relative Apocalypse and the kind of possibility of extinction that you're talking about.

Vinay Gupta  18:08  
The extinction thing is a separate bucket. So okay, the kind of collaps that we're talking about here in terms of the cultural collapses, the social collapses, even though some of the environmental collapses, that stuff is not unprecedented in human history. Right? We've seen that before. And, you know, it doesn't seem real to people that it could happen to them until it does. You know, if you think the standard of living drop that you've seen since 2008. In America, you know, life expectancy is going down, rather than up. You've got the opioid epidemic. You've got tons of murder, there's enormous amounts of homelessness, vast amounts of college debt, which amounts basically to indentured servitude, you just pick your master but you know, you graduate with three years of income of debt. All of that sort of stuff is, you know a civilization, which is sliding backwards, life is getting worse rather than better. And if that continues for another 20 years, think about how bad things would be in the states. So that's your kind of tier one problem, which is the people that have been historically victors in the global, you know, cultural economic imperialist game are rapidly becoming losers. And it's not that they're becoming losers because somebody else is coming in and invading. It's a much more complicated set factors which will result in the decline of the West. But there's no doubt at all the decline in the West is happening right. 

Now. Problem one, right, problem two, you've got the whole global warming routine. Right. And the global warming routine, basically, to be honest, not much of that matters. Right? Yeah, it's getting a bit hotter. It's getting a bit weird. The weather's getting a lot more violent dah dah dah dah dah, but not much of that stuff really matters until agriculture breaks. But if you get a drought that knocks down food production by 20% food prices go through the roof, lots of poor people starve, then they become violent, then the states begin to fail all over the world. Right? And you know, you could easily imagine a famine which would starve a couple hundred million people to death. If that happens, the world will never be the same again, because probably 40% of the countries in the world will collapse. 

Because what do you think happens if you're a poor country, right? If you were in, I don't know, Lesotho or Liberia or Zimbabwe, and food quadruples in price. You know, you're going to get really, really apocalyptic conditions very, very, very quickly. Because the poor will start to starve and then they'll start to fight. And then the rich will machine gun them in large numbers and either the poor will win those fights or they'll lose. And none of this is unprecedented, right. We've seen situations like that in other countries, year after year after year, after year all those famines in Africa where a million people starved or 2 million people starved or 5 million people starved. You know, Ethiopia, all the rest of that stuff. These things happen over and over and over and over again. But because they happen a long, long way away, nobody cares. I mean, I care about this stuff. I can't even list off the African famines, right?  Now, I can't tell you off the top of my fingers. Why? Because a million people dying isn't even a statistic to me. And okay, I'm concerned about prevention rather than the history.  But to give you a sense of how little we care, we don't care enough to know. You kind of think that everybody ought to know that a million people starve to death we can't even remember the names of the events.

Daniel Thorson  21:44  
Yeah. Well, it's overwhelming. There's so much. There's I mean, if you are opening to the suffering of the world, then it seems endless.

Vinay Gupta  21:55  
Well, that's because it is endless

I mean, you know, We've got 7 billion people.

You know, an awful lot of them are really miserable and there are a lot of them.

Daniel Thorson  22:07  
Right? Well, what I what I guess that that means? And I think I have my own answer for this, but it's like, why even pay attention to it? If it is endless, I think there's an intuitive sense that it's endless. So it's like, well, I don't even want to go there.

Vinay Gupta  22:22  
Well, the choice is pretty simple. You either pay attention, or become a demon. But I mean, if you're the kind of person that can make it through this world without having any real awareness of what's happening to other people, you're a monster. And we live in a society which is a monster factory, it produces monsters, as this condition of existence. If you're going to operate a successful Empire, the people in the Empire have to turn a blind eye to where money comes from and they have to be willing to kill to get things done.

Daniel Thorson  22:49  
Right. Yeah. Yep. 

Vinay Gupta  22:53   It's a monster factory. 

Daniel Thorson  22:55  
Right. Okay. Yeah.

And I think, you know, I agree with that. I think that people listening to this show probably see the truth in what you say. And it's also a great sort of pivot point to talk about spiritual practice, I think. And so here's the context that we're in, right. You know, collapse is happening in the First World probably, quite soon. extinction is a real possibility. That's the age that we live in. That's the context which we're a lot...

Vinay Gupta  23:24  
I wanna, I want to really drive something home, right? It's not the collapse is happening, right? What you call poverty is collapse. Right? All those homeless people that's collapse, all those people dying without health insurance, that's collapse. All those people who are addicted to opioids, because their doctors will write them a prescription and their health insurance will provide the drug that will kill them that is collapse. The thing about collapse is it's not until that happens to you or your immediate family or your very closest friends that you recognize it as collapse, up until then it's just economics. Hmm. Right? The collapse is already here. It's just not equally distributed. Right. And that's not something that came into existence accidentally. There's an enormous list on Wikipedia of the African politicians that were assassinated. Almost anybody in Africa that talks with any kind of sincerity about Pan africanism, about the idea of Africa unifying, so that it could cut much more reasonable trade deals with the rest of the world. Almost anybody that talks about that with any kind of passion and momentum with any kind of authority got shot in the head, right. And whether it was the director of the CIA or the Russians or somebody else, or whoever the hell did it. The bottom line is the pattern is very clearly there. It's an enormous campaign of political assasination, to stop the Africans getting to their feet and negotiating a fair price for the resources. 

So that's not an accident. The massive enslavement of the American youth by student loan debt. That's not an accident. This stuff is happening, because people are figuring out how to concentrate wealth in the hands of the few. Because it's better in this world to be rich than poor for the most part. So the people that want to take care of their families that want their kids to have health insurance that want to be able to go on vacation and take their dogs because they've got a nice big car, those people wind up doing a bunch of really unethical things, not because they're bastards, but because they love their children more than they love you. Right? It's the people attempting to take care of their immediate families and blinding themselves to everybody else's suffering because their zone of concern is their people that creates the vast majority of the machinery, the incentives for the kind wide scale miseration(?) that we see. This is the worst of the problem is this stuff is not being done by hate. It's being done by love.

That's why it's so hard to stop.

Yeah, welcome to Hell

Daniel Thorson  26:07  
Yeah.

Yeah and whuah..

Vinay Gupta  26:11  
Right. It's brutal. It's absolutely brutal.

Daniel Thorson  26:15  
It is brutal and it does like it. You know, I even think of like my own family members, right, like I have a .. who are participating in the system that is downstream causing all of the all the suffering in a more direct way than I you know, I I've always been extremely ambivalent about getting a job and doing the things that are prescribed by the American dream, which is we talked about previously dead, but you know, that that they, they they're having a family, they're going to their job and it is out of love. It is out of like, this is what seems to be on the menu for me to do with my life. And I just .. how do we relate to the fact that it's not hatred at the root of it, that it's love but what how do we how do we respond to that situation of love, giving rise to great suffering and, you know, destroying the planet?

Vinay Gupta  27:18  
The Love is not enough.

It's just not.  Right? It's by no means the highest virtue.

Daniel Thorson  27:28  
So what's the step? What's the step after?

Yeah, what do you need?

Vinay Gupta  27:32  
What you need to correct this problem is truth.

And you can see this in the traditional Hindu chakra model, right? You know, above the heart chakra is the throat chakra, the symbol of love. Above the symbol of love is a symbol of truth. If we tell ourselves the truth or the consequences of our actions, we are no longer able to act in the way that we have marketed and this is the problem that we have is that all of these people, you know, have a narrow scope of concern. They love the people they love. Strangers are strangers. They'll turn a blind eye to a stranger's suffering because you know, at the end of the day, if I don't do this job, somebody else will. They do the best they can to take care of people that they have immediate connection with. But the intellectual world model is so shoddy and so inadequate, that they can't see the second and third and fourth order effects of the actions that they've taken both individually and especially collectively. Right? Everybody assumes that you know, you won't go you vote for who is available to vote, you've done your part political participation. But again, it's the monster factory, right? You're not going to be able to vote for anybody in America that's going to dismantle the nuclear weapons stockpile, or restructure American society to be zero carbon. Right. Those things are just not going to represent these options. So everybody feels like they do the best they can. But it's the sum total of everybody do the best they can't isn't good enough. Nobody feels personal responsible. But it's not just diffusion of responsibility, the limited zones concern, and the unwillingness to think holistically about other people suffering. It's all those things stacked up on each other, that produce this enormous ability to consume the world and consume other people on the way to having security for own kids. 

Daniel Thorson  29:23  
And for those of us, who are if we are able to see through the, all of these, this full stack to whatever degree we can of delusions and problematic world models like what, what what what, what is your relationship? And what do you recommend as a relationship to the monsters or the monster factory? Like how do we relate to that situation.

Vinay Gupta  29:51  
So, at the end of the day, in all probability, we're going to be unable to fix society in amount of time that we've got. So what we're looking for is nasty cheap hacks to try and buy us enough time to do something about resource scarcity, if people have enough material possessions in a stable enough economic and to some degree social and cultural niche, that they don't feel the need to immediately butcher their neighbors for resources, to some degree, we could get people to chill out. And, you know, doing enough about material scarcity that we could get people to chill out a little is about all that I think is realistic at this point in history. Right. And, you know, you certainly can things like basic income, and there are many arguments against basic income. There are many arguments for basic income, but at the end of the day, even a sort of, you know, third rate implementation of basic income is likely to stop people starving in the streets. You don't even look at a crappy job a basic income. It's probably not going to get rid of homelessness, but it is probably going to get rid of hunger. Right, it's probably not going to get rid of people that are uninsured. But it's likely to get rid of all the people that end up living off cat food. You know what I'm saying? Like, you know, we're not very good at catching people as they slide off economic cliff. And, you know, even a lousy implementation of basic income is I could go pretty good job of stopping that. And, you know, the consequence of that may well be a large scale reduction in crime, a large scale reduction in the kind of ghettoization of people that are poor and have always be poor. Because the worst part being poor for many people is instability and precarity. It's a constant stress of not knowing where money is coming from. If you know where the money is coming from you can get good optimizing within that fixed budget. Yeah. So I think you might be able to pull an enormous amount of the pain and anxiety out of society with schemes like this. I think when you think about Scandinavia, it's gonna be as you know, such high quality welfare states. They are You know, more or less equivalent to baisc incom in terms of their scope of the comprehensiveness. Surely enough of these societies do seem to be a lot more chilled out. Right? I'm not saying that people are any happier, but they're less aggressively vicious and they're measurably less volatile. You know, I mean, I used to live on the south side of Chicago. And, you know, that was a menacing, menacing, menacing place, relative to anywhere that I've seen in Scandanavia, that there are social factors that are cultural factors that are historical factors that are structural racism, there's 50 other reasons, but I'm willing to bet that the Southside of Chicago is a much less scary place if everyone gets $1,000 a month check from the government, you know, summer or winter rain or shine, (Godspeed or women's studies)?. You know, if the worst thing happens to you, is that you wind up couchsurfing with 1000 bucks a month. And you know, somehow you scrape by Because there's always going to be enough money that they eat we've got, you know, we start each day with $35 in your pocket. You know, nobody has an existential crisis that morning with $35 in their pocket unless they've got health issues.

You may not have a place to sleep, but you will not starve.

And, you know, this is not a radical doctrine, right? I'm not talking about fixing all the world's problems or producing a massively fairer society. I'm just saying, maybe we could stop shoving people into the abyss with a bulldozer and see whether that that makes the rest of us less afraid. Yeah. Right. No, this is a very, very limited doctrine. Right. You know, you take you know, Africa, you know, malaria, bed nets, agricultural stabilization, maybe a lot of work on getting a fair price for good resources. There are a huge number of things that you couldn't get done relatively cheaply, that wouldn't be very helpful. You know, that There's a lot of stuff that could be done fairly affordably if we were willing to focus the effort on the very simple stuff and get stuff done and get it right. You know, how hard could it be right? But then instead, what we have is this very, very complex, very (rural)?, pretty convoluted, you know, sort of general spectrum of concern, we're unable to prioritize, we can't tell the difference between immediate good and long term good. And we don't effectively monitor for where the money is spent, you know, that there's a real sense of, right, we're just going to get the basics done, and all the rest of the rest of the stuff is gonna have to wait. Instead, we have, you know, equal priority given to, you know, things, which are radically different levels of urgency in radically different levels of criticality. It's all in bucket marked, help, aid concern whatever that'll. Also we're not great and noticing that we're kind of shooting people in one hand then go around handing out bondages with the other, which also doen't help.

Daniel Thorson  35:05  
Right on. Yeah, that's I mean, that's consistent with what I'm seeing is that maybe there are many things that we can do that would improve the state of the world, but a universal basic income would be, seems like it kind of like Keystone change that would facilitate many other downstream positive impacts. And so what i what i appreciate, Vinay, is that, you know, we started this conversation talking about your own process of awakening. And I think most people who have had an awakening experience and are speaking publicly about it, if you then ask them, like, what should we do in this time of crisis, will say something about a revolution in consciousness, right, or something like that. Whereas what I appreciate about you, is that you share the most are actually practical, but Still, you know, quite visionary, but but really practical solution to this current state of the world. And maybe we could talk a little bit about, you know, what differentiates your perspective from so many other people who are kind of associated with the milleiu of awakened beings on this planet, so to speak.

Vinay Gupta  36:22  
Well, I'll tell you what the crux of this is, right?

I mean, the main work that I have in the world is the hexayurt. And the hexayurt is basically the world's cheapest way of making houses. You know, it's a couple hundred dollars a unit, it's 12 sheets of plywood, you cut six of them in half. You make those into a shallow cone for the roof, and then you lift that and drop the walls. And the walls are six, four sheets of plywood lying on their side so they're four feet high. You can make them more insulating materials you can make about fancier materials, but it's just meant to be the cheapest way of turning industrial sheet materials coming out of enormous factory into, you know, something which is much more durable and robust than a tent. I'm working at that level because that's where the problem is, right? We're not in a world that has hundreds of thousands of people who are meditating six hours a day because their hunger for enlightenment is greater than any other single driving force. Right? Right. And if the people don't want it, they're not going to get there. Right? I mean, this is this is brutally simple, right? I hear everybody talking about higher fucking consciousness. And like, I know how hard it is to get like, right I did that and, fuck me, it's a really fucking difficult, right? I mean, you know, I am really, really capable human being right. I really am extraordinarily capable. I went from 14 to 26. And I did not do another thing that mattered in my goddamn life except the work on consciousness. Right. 12 years have, you know, one of the smartest and toughest human beings alive to get that done. Now? I mean, that's not unlike what it says the literature, right? The Hindu literature is pretty clear like, this is really fucking difficult. If you're going to do this you're not going to get much else done. It might take three decades, if you're going to try and maintain something of a household or existence at the same time, it's going to turn your shit upside down. I've got the time and energy to do that, because I was incredibly materially lucky, right? And I wasn't materially lucky in that I was born with money. I was material lucky in that people would let me sleep on their floors. And that's how I got there, right. So, you know, it's not that we've got any ambiguity but what it takes to get people enlightened and what we don't have is a lot of people that are willing to do the work and enough places for the bastards to sleep. Right. You know, if the entire kind of climate activism world was doing like, two hours Meditation a day and kung fu lessons, you know, I would sort of take this prospect of mass-awankening a lot more serious, right? But show me the mass effort before we start talking about the master result. Right, right.

Daniel Thorson  39:14  
Right. Well, and I will say like, you know, that rings true in my experience, you know, the monastic Academy where I'm moving back to when I lived there previously, it was a real struggle to get anybody to even want to come. You know, like, we were like, Look, you can come here, we will fully support you. In your journey to awakening. We'll give you good food, you know, place to sleep, great teaching, and like, not many people were down.

Vinay Gupta  39:40  
Frankly, if that had existed, you know, in the 1990s, you would not have been able to get written up to get rid of me, right. I would have kicked down your motherfucking door. But people that I ever met, right, I was literally one of the I was alone on that track. Probably met five or six people in my entire life that worked that hard on spiritual stuff. I mean, okay, there are people that are teaching and all the rest of that stuff, but in terms of like my peers, people I meet, you know, in business or in ordinary life or you know, going to places like Burning Man or whatever like, the number of people that were my peers in my generation that were working the hard on spiritual stuff, it's probably half a dozen people of all the people that I've ever met.

Right? So, there is no doubt that having the material support structure really helps because some of the people that want to get there will die on the way if they don't have this. But, you know, there's there's no denying that that material support structure is incredibly important. But if we're going to be talking about mass awakening, there has to be mass effort, and there's no mass effort, right? 

Daniel Thorson  40:50  
And yet, right we see the widespread practice of things like mindfulness meditation and yoga, and I mean, there's got tons of people who either outright or are essentially saying like, Look, I haven't had some kind of enlightenment experience. Often, if you read more closely, you know, they've practiced as a householder for 5 10 15 years, like there is some kind of weird merging together of like capitalism, and enlightenment traditions, which, I suspect is why we're finding it hard to locate the people who actually want to completely dive in because instead of like, you know, where it used to be in Zen was like, okay, you want to do this and then get into the monastery and grind for a decade or more. But now it's like, oh, you can read this book and like, you know, you don't need to do that you can get awakening in this eight week course. And it's chill. And so I guess I'm curious what your thoughts are around that, that tension of like, what is it what is happening as these awakenings traditions encounter capitalism and what's going on there?

Vinay Gupta  42:05  
 Uh, nothing.

Literally nothing right. You know, people like to talk about the widespread adoption of yoga as being a great thing. And you know there are eight limbs of yoga right, Yama, niyama, Asana, pranayama, pratyahara, dharana, Dianna, sahmdi.  My pronunciation in Sanskrit is terrible. So the first two limbs of yoga are all very carefully designed moral constraints necessary for the practice of yoga to be reasonably safe. And you're meant to get that stuff sorted out before you start doing the sanas. So the first thing is, next to no effort is going into building the moral foundation necessary for yoga to function properly among Western practitioners. I think the vast majority of people doing yoga could not name but the yamas and niyamas are certainly have no concrete disciplined, practice of those things. Maybe some of the yoga teachers, maybe they know academically, they're certainly not doing the practice.  Problem one. Then you get Asana, the physical postures, which is what everybody's doing. So my understanding of tradition is that the physical postures that are to transmute the kind of heavy inert dense materiality of the body into energy, what they call tamas in the rajas. So do all these postures that liberate lots of energy, it produces a kind of fire inside of you. The fire inside of you, if you continue to generate it past the amount that you need for the next phase of practice, turns you into an extremely athletic sex fiend with boundless physical energy and no common sense.

Does that sound familiar?

Right. They're not doing yoga. Yoga is a multi stage process of transformation. They've taken the One of the engines of transformation, and they're using it for animal ends they are taking the body and they're turning it from something which is dense and heavy into something just energetic and fiery, because they think it's more fun to be energetic and firey then is to be dense and heavy, well, that might be true, but that's an animal end.  It's not yoga. Yoga is the process of transformation. An individual part of that process. It's like calling the wheel a car. They're not doing yoga. Your doing asana practice, asana practice outside of the practice of yoga does not achieve the ends of yoga.  Its not yoga, right? It's asana practice. Now, if you don't do the pranayama, the body becomes more and more and more and more filled with animal energy. As people become more and more more driven by animal passions, they'll become more and more and more successfully animalistic they get good at what to get good power, the money. They get good at sex. They are in excellent physical health is exceeding all the animal goals. Great, fantastic, right? It's probably better that we have people that are happy animals and Santa animals, but they're not going anywhere. Right? They're just being more successful and setting a cage they were born and so how the hell is this going to help anybody other than keeping them up geriatric wards (will give each set of ticks)?. So, the pranayama effect, right? You know, that's all the different breathing exercises. But what they should be doing is transitioning onto pranayama discipline way, as they get the hatha yoga practice matures. You get to lesson three, then they'll get good at lesson three, you start working on lesson four, you begin to move your energy to the next step in the bath. But this is this is like elementary stuff. I taught teacher training in Chicago for yoga teachers 15 years ago, on pratyahara next thing you do after pranayama, right, the first of the meditations practices inside to the yoga system. Nobody has any idea how pratyahara even is, there's practically no ranking about begins to write two lines in the yoga sutra. Because everybody was meant to know what it was, it wasn't something that can hardly be explained. Even yoga teachers have no freaking idea or pratyahara is or how to do anything.

Daniel Thorson  46:18  
So,

Vinay Gupta  46:19  
you know, a similar kind of total destruction of knowledge has happened inside of mindful. Yeah. Right. You know, like, for God's sakes, people, this is not the real thing. And this is the kind of capitalist processing of the cultural material of Asia into something to allow people to continue on their orbits with a few more trinkets. So, you know, some of the people will go on to have nervous breakdowns, some of those people will go into Kundalini experiences, some of those people will find good teachers and get on the path in some kind of realistic way. But I think it's important that we understand that these things are stripmining in all of Asia's spiritual traditions rather than being authentic practice. I'm not suggesting that people should stop, right? I'm not suggesting that, you know, we've got our Asian imperialist hat on and say, Oh, no, you must not do yoga Yoga is, you know, not for, you white boy, you no no no, if they're doing yoga, they're getting something out of yoga, let them do, right. It's better for them not doing that. Some of them will explode some of them will do mindfulness and go crazy. But at the end of the day, you know, for most of them, it's a distinct improvement of what we're going to be doing otherwise, but let's not confuse it with being part of a genuine spiritual trajectory. 

Daniel Thorson  47:29  
Yeah, well, I remember I first got into meditation in college and actually wrote my, one of my senior essays on Slavoj echecks critique of Buddhism. And I at the time, I actually disagreed with him. But now after practicing in the west for, you know, over a decade, it it seems to be hauntingly true. You know, he essentially says that Western Buddhism is establishing itself as the kind of hegemonic ideology of global capitalism that allows people to continue to participate in what you call these kind of monstrous behavior patterns without seeing the third effect, you know, the causal effects down the line, while still feeling like all chilled out and peaceful. And I guess, you know, that seems to be looking in from the outside and my increasing concern for the role that particularly like mindfulness meditation is playing in our culture is that it seems to be almost anesthetizing people are kind of like tranquilizer so that they can be okay. In the midst of the insanity of our current civilization design. And so, I guess, you know, if if we buy that

perspective, and I think you and I are more or less than agreement, they're like, what then is a way to think about an approach and sort of like, understand what is on offer with spiritual practice if we're going to, you know, not kind of Co Op them and if we're actually going to look back at the roots of the tradition and and what what role do they have in relationship to this time of crisis and collapse and possible extinction? Like do they offer what do they offer us whatever, what is their role properly understood?

Vinay Gupta  49:25  
So, here, we have to face some very fundamental truths about situation that we're in, right? Roughly a third of the planet's population, are followers of either Christianity or Islam. And both of those traditions have a very apocalyptic vision for humanity's collective spiritual evolution. The fundamental belief system is that individuals have to do a certain set of things in order to observe their own salvation. But collectively there is a process by which the world will go to a greater or a lesser degree be destroyed. And then on the far side of that you get kind of spiritual dictatorship in which everything gets sorted out. Now, for people that have been immersed in those kind of ideologies for a really long time, the world being on this trajectory doesn't look wrong. Right? It doesn't raise a profound alarm bell in the heart of Christian, to see that the world is going to hell in a handbasket, because that's what happens before the Apocalypse and the resurrection and all the rest of the stuff that happens, right? This is just not an alarm condition for about a third of the world's population. This is what it ought to look like if everything's happening according to the divine plan.

We have some real cultural problems here.

And against that, you put 1% of those populations who are getting a little bit uncomfortable. with what's happenging, and then a small fraction of that 1% that are doing some kind of spiritual practice, even if it's just mindfulness stuff and hatha yoga. You see what I'm saying? Yeah. Right. It's it's totally insignificant. It makes a lot of noise in terms of it's something because we're going to write articles about, but in terms of the actual machinery of the world that's pushing us down these trajectories. There is zero evidence, any of this crap makes any difference at all. Right. I mean, you know, this is a doctrine of total nihilism. And it's not that I have no hope. But if we continue to have false hope, rather than concentrating our fire on the genuine targets, which was a real possibility for effecting change, bugger-all is going to happen. And either right or wrong. My role ecosystem seems to be to spend a lot of time exterminating false hope and getting people to pay attention to the handful of things we've got left. That might actually get something done.
